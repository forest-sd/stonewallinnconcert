The Stonewall Inn was one of the few places where LGBTQ+ individuals could gather openly in an era when homosexuality was criminalized and raids on gay bars were routine. The uprising was led largely by transgender women of color, drag queens, and homeless LGBTQ+ youth — the most marginalized members of an already marginalized community. Their courage transformed a moment of oppression into a movement that has reshaped law, culture, and the meaning of civil rights worldwide. Today the Stonewall Inn is a National Historic Landmark, but its greatest legacy isn't a building — it's the ongoing fight for dignity, safety, and equality that its patrons ignited.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Why Music Has Always Been Central to LGBTQ+ Liberation</h3><p>From disco to punk to house music to hip-hop, LGBTQ+ communities have always used music as both refuge and resistance. Ballroom culture created entire musical genres. Gay clubs incubated dance music that would reshape mainstream pop. Queer punk challenged homophobia in hardcore scenes. Trans artists pushed boundaries in every genre. Music creates community through shared experience, provides language for feelings that words alone can't capture, and builds solidarity across differences. The Safe Spaces Concert continues this tradition, using performance to celebrate identity, process grief, express joy, and remind every attendee that they belong.</p></div></div></div></section>
